               Before you do anything else with any SDS/2 assemblies,
               call Linker.Link with appropriate version requirements.
               This class will find the other SDS/2 .net assemblies from
               that.  You should copy the assembly for this class and
               distribute it with your program (DesignData.SDS2.Linker.dll).
            
               But that's the only SDS/2 assembly you should distribute/copy.

             <summary>
               Call this to find the installed SDS/2 libraries on the
               system and use them.
            
               This has to be called before entering a function that used
               any other SDS/2 assemblies.  So, if your Main method doesn't
               you can call this there, or if it does you can simply declare
               a static readonly bool and assign it to the result of calling
               this.  That variable will be initialized (and so this will be called)
               before entering Main, and before .Net will try to load any other
               SDS/2 assemblies.

                 The minimum minor version required, often this should

             <remarks>
               This will not allow you to link against multiple major versions with
               the same program.  You have to choose one to use at the start.  You can
               only call this once, any more calls will throw.

              Generally you don't want this, you want a versioned variant which will find
              this path by looking at installation artifacts in the windows registry.
